"The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component of a computer "
"that acts as its \"control center.\" The CPU, also referred to as the "
"\"central\" or \"main\" processor, is a complex set of electronic circuitry "
"that runs the machine's operating system and apps. The CPU interprets, "
"processes and executes instructions, most often from the hardware and "
"software programs running on the device."

"The CPU performs arithmetic, logic, and other operations to transform data "
"input into more usable information output. While the CPU must contain at "
"least one processing core, many contain multiple cores. A server with two "
"hexa-core CPUs, for example, will have a total of 12 processors."

"Running multiple processor units simultaneously allows for multi-tasking and "
"can dramatically improve performance. But while important, the number of "
"cores and processors aren't the only factors that need to be taken into "
"consideration. To determine the best CPU for a project, developers typically "
"focus on the specific applications that will be dependent on the CPU and "
"identify the most important features based on those apps' requirements. "
"Among the many things to consider are: "
